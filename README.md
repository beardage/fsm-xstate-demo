# FSM-XState-Demo: RPS Fighter

This is a demo project to go along with my presentation Finite State Machines For UI w/ XState.

It's an extremely simple game with all the UI and state powered by XState. Feel free to fork/copy/enhance etc :)

I used: 
t3 
  - typescript
  - nextjs
  - tailwind
@statelyai
  - xstate
  - @statelyai/inspect
